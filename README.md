# ShortThis
Toy project to put hands on how to deploy an API
Aim is to make a url shortner in python

Steps :
- Create a route so client may input his url and we send the shortned version
- Create a second route to redirect on the right url
- Build a database to store the information
- Test route with postman
- Make frontend (React ?)

Don't forget that :
- The set of caracters that will appear in the short url should be define so it is no so complicated
- Define a max size for the short url
